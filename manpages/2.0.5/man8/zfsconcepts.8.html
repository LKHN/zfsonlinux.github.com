<B>zfsconcepts</B>

 - An overview of ZFS concepts.



<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>ZFS File System Hierarchy</H3>

A ZFS storage pool is a logical collection of devices that provide space for
datasets.
A storage pool is also the root of the ZFS file system hierarchy.
<P>

The root of the pool can be accessed as a file system, such as mounting and
unmounting, taking snapshots, and setting properties.
The physical storage characteristics, however, are managed by the
<A HREF="/man/man2html?8+zpool">zpool</A>(8)


command.
<P>

See
<A HREF="/man/man2html?8+zpool">zpool</A>(8)


for more information on creating and administering pools.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Snapshots</H3>

A snapshot is a read-only copy of a file system or volume.
Snapshots can be created extremely quickly, and initially consume no additional
space within the pool.
As data within the active dataset changes, the snapshot consumes more data than
would otherwise be shared with the active dataset.
<P>

Snapshots can have arbitrary names.
Snapshots of volumes can be cloned or rolled back, visibility is determined
by the
<B>snapdev</B>

property of the parent volume.
<P>

File system snapshots can be accessed under the
.zfs/snapshot

directory in the root of the file system.
Snapshots are automatically mounted on demand and may be unmounted at regular
intervals.
The visibility of the
.zfs

directory can be controlled by the
<B>snapdir</B>

property.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Bookmarks</H3>

A bookmark is like a snapshot, a read-only copy of a file system or volume.
Bookmarks can be created extremely quickly, compared to snapshots, and they
consume no additional space within the pool. Bookmarks can also have arbitrary
names, much like snapshots.
<P>

Unlike snapshots, bookmarks can not be accessed through the filesystem in any
way. From a storage standpoint a bookmark just provides a way to reference
when a snapshot was created as a distinct object. Bookmarks are initially
tied to a snapshot, not the filesystem or volume, and they will survive if the
snapshot itself is destroyed. Since they are very light weight there's little
incentive to destroy them.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Clones</H3>

A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial contents are the same
as another dataset.
As with snapshots, creating a clone is nearly instantaneous, and initially
consumes no additional space.
<P>

Clones can only be created from a snapshot.
When a snapshot is cloned, it creates an implicit dependency between the parent
and child.
Even though the clone is created somewhere else in the dataset hierarchy, the
original snapshot cannot be destroyed as long as a clone exists.
The
<B>origin</B>

property exposes this dependency, and the
<B>destroy</B>

command lists any such dependencies, if they exist.
<P>

The clone parent-child dependency relationship can be reversed by using the
<B>promote</B>

subcommand.
This causes the
Qq origin

file system to become a clone of the specified file system, which makes it
possible to destroy the file system that the clone was created from.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Mount Points</H3>

Creating a ZFS file system is a simple operation, so the number of file systems
per system is likely to be numerous.
To cope with this, ZFS automatically manages mounting and unmounting file
systems without the need to edit the
/etc/fstab

file.
All automatically managed file systems are mounted by ZFS at boot time.
<P>

By default, file systems are mounted under
/path

 
where
<I>path</I>

is the name of the file system in the ZFS namespace.
Directories are created and destroyed as needed.
<P>

A file system can also have a mount point set in the
<B>mountpoint</B>

property.
This directory is created as needed, and ZFS automatically mounts the file
system when the
<B>zfs mount -a</B>





command is invoked
Po without editing

/etc/fstab

Pc .

The
<B>mountpoint</B>

property can be inherited, so if
<I>pool/home</I>

has a mount point of
/export/stuff

 
then
<I>pool/home/user</I>

automatically inherits a mount point of
/export/stuff/user

 
<P>

A file system
<B>mountpoint</B>

property of
<B>none</B>

prevents the file system from being mounted.
<P>

If needed, ZFS file systems can also be managed with traditional tools
Po <B>mount</B>

 

<B>umount</B>

 
/etc/fstab

Pc .

If a file system's mount point is set to
<B>legacy</B>

 
ZFS makes no attempt to manage the file system, and the administrator is
responsible for mounting and unmounting the file system. Because pools must
be imported before a legacy mount can succeed, administrators should ensure
that legacy mounts are only attempted after the zpool import process
finishes at boot time. For example, on machines using systemd, the mount
option
<P>

<B>x-systemd.requires=zfs-import.target</B>

<P>

will ensure that the zfs-import completes before systemd attempts mounting
the filesystem. See <A HREF="/man/man2html?5+systemd.mount">systemd.mount</A>(5) for details.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Deduplication</H3>

Deduplication is the process for removing redundant data at the block level,
reducing the total amount of data stored. If a file system has the
<B>dedup</B>

property enabled, duplicate data blocks are removed synchronously. The result
is that only unique data is stored and common components are shared among files.
<P>

Deduplicating data is a very resource-intensive operation. It is generally
recommended that you have at least 1.25 GiB of RAM per 1 TiB of storage when
you enable deduplication. Calculating the exact requirement depends heavily
on the type of data stored in the pool.
<P>

Enabling deduplication on an improperly-designed system can result in
performance issues (slow IO and administrative operations). It can potentially
lead to problems importing a pool due to memory exhaustion. Deduplication
can consume significant processing power (CPU) and memory as well as generate
additional disk IO.
<P>

Before creating a pool with deduplication enabled, ensure that you have planned
your hardware requirements appropriately and implemented appropriate recovery
practices, such as regular backups. As an alternative to deduplication
consider using
<B>compression=on</B>

 
as a less resource-intensive alternative.
