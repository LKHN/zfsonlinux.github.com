<I>clone-filesystem</I>

<DD>

<DD>The
<B>promote</B>

command makes it possible to destroy the file system that the clone was created
from.
The clone parent-child dependency relationship is reversed, so that the origin
file system becomes a clone of the specified file system.
<P>

The snapshot that was cloned, and any snapshots previous to this snapshot, are
now owned by the promoted clone.
The space they use moves from the origin file system to the promoted clone, so
enough space must be available to accommodate these snapshots.
No new space is consumed by this operation, but the space accounting is
adjusted.
The promoted clone must not have any conflicting snapshot names of its own.
The
zfs-rename8


subcommand can be used to rename any conflicting snapshots.
