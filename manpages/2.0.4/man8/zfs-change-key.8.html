<DD>Load the key for
<I>filesystem</I>

 
allowing it and all children that inherit the
<B>keylocation</B>

property to be accessed. The key will be expected in the format specified by the
<B>keyformat</B>

and location specified by the
<B>keylocation</B>

property. Note that if the
<B>keylocation</B>

is set to
<B>prompt</B>

the terminal will interactively wait for the key to be entered. Loading a key
will not automatically mount the dataset. If that functionality is desired,
<B>zfs mount -l</B>





will ask for the key and mount the dataset

Once the key is loaded the

<DD>Unloads a key from ZFS, removing the ability to access the dataset and all of
its children that inherit the

the key is unloaded the

<DD>

<DD>Changes the user's key (e.g. a passphrase) used to access a dataset. This
command requires that the existing key for the dataset is already loaded into
ZFS. This command may also be used to change the
<B>keylocation</B>

 
<B>keyformat</B>

 
and
<B>pbkdf2iters</B>

properties as needed. If the dataset was not previously an encryption root it
will become one. Alternatively, the
-<B>i</B>

flag may be provided to cause an encryption root to inherit the parent's key
instead.
<P>

If the user's key is compromised,
<B>zfs change-key</B>



does not necessarily protect existing or newly-written data from attack.
Newly-written data will continue to be encrypted with the same master key as
the existing data.  The master key is compromised if an attacker obtains a
user key and the corresponding wrapped master key. Currently,
<B>zfs change-key</B>



does not overwrite the previous wrapped master key on disk, so it is
accessible via forensic analysis for an indeterminate length of time.
<P>

In the event of a master key compromise, ideally the drives should be securely
erased to remove all the old data (which is readable using the compromised
master key), a new pool created, and the data copied back. This can be
approximated in place by creating new datasets, copying the data
(e.g. using
<B>zfs send</B>



|
<B>zfs recv ), and then clearing the free space with</B>





<B>zpool trim --secure</B>



if supported by your hardware, otherwise
<B>zpool initialize </B>

<DD>
Allows the user to set encryption key properties (

<B>keylocation</B>

 
and

<B>keyformat</B>

and
<B>pbkdf2iters</B>

after the dataset has been created.

encryption root that has an encrypted parent.

<H3>Encryption</H3>

Enabling the
<B>encryption</B>

feature allows for the creation of encrypted filesystems and volumes.  ZFS
will encrypt file and zvol data, file attributes, ACLs, permission bits,
directory listings, FUID mappings, and
<B>userused</B>

/
<B>groupused</B>

data.  ZFS will not encrypt metadata related to the pool structure, including
dataset and snapshot names, dataset hierarchy, properties, file size, file
holes, and deduplication tables (though the deduplicated data itself is
encrypted).
<P>

Key rotation is managed by ZFS.  Changing the user's key (e.g. a passphrase)
does not require re-encrypting the entire dataset.  Datasets can be scrubbed,
resilvered, renamed, and deleted without the encryption keys being loaded (see the
<B>zfs load-key</B>



subcommand for more info on key loading).
<P>

Creating an encrypted dataset requires specifying the
<B>encryption</B>

and
<B>keyformat</B>

properties at creation time, along with an optional
<B>keylocation</B>

and
<B>pbkdf2iters</B>

 
After entering an encryption key, the
created dataset will become an encryption root. Any descendant datasets will
inherit their encryption key from the encryption root by default, meaning that
loading, unloading, or changing the key for the encryption root will implicitly
do the same for all inheriting datasets. If this inheritance is not desired,
simply supply a
<B>keyformat</B>

when creating the child dataset or use
<B>zfs change-key</B>



to break an existing relationship, creating a new encryption root on the child.
Note that the child's
<B>keyformat</B>

may match that of the parent while still creating a new encryption root, and
that changing the
<B>encryption</B>

property alone does not create a new encryption root; this would simply use a
different cipher suite with the same key as its encryption root. The one
exception is that clones will always use their origin's encryption key.
As a result of this exception, some encryption-related properties (namely
<B>keystatus</B>

 
<B>keyformat</B>

 
<B>keylocation</B>

 
and
<B>pbkdf2iters</B>

 
do not inherit like other ZFS properties and instead use the value determined
by their encryption root. Encryption root inheritance can be tracked via the
read-only
<B>encryptionroot</B>

property.
<P>

Encryption changes the behavior of a few ZFS
operations. Encryption is applied after compression so compression ratios are
preserved. Normally checksums in ZFS are 256 bits long, but for encrypted data
the checksum is 128 bits of the user-chosen checksum and 128 bits of MAC from
the encryption suite, which provides additional protection against maliciously
altered data. Deduplication is still possible with encryption enabled but for
security, datasets will only dedup against themselves, their snapshots, and
their clones.
<P>

There are a few limitations on encrypted datasets. Encrypted data cannot be
embedded via the
<B>embedded_data</B>

feature. Encrypted datasets may not have
<B>copies = </B><I>3</I>







since the implementation stores some encryption metadata where the third copy
would normally be. Since compression is applied before encryption datasets may
be vulnerable to a CRIME-like attack if applications accessing the data allow
for it. Deduplication with encryption will leak information about which blocks
are equivalent in a dataset and will incur an extra CPU cost per block written.
