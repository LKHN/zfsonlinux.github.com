<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B></B>


command configures ZFS datasets within a ZFS storage pool, as described in
<A HREF="../man8/zpool.8.html">zpool</A>(8).


A dataset is identified by a unique path within the ZFS namespace.
For example:

<PRE>
pool/{filesystem,volume,snapshot}
</PRE>

<P>

where the maximum length of a dataset name is
<B>MAXNAMELEN</B>

(256 bytes)

 
<P>

A dataset can be one of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>file system</B>


<DD>
A ZFS dataset of type
<B>filesystem</B>

can be mounted within the standard system namespace and behaves like other file
systems.
While ZFS file systems are designed to be POSIX compliant, known issues exist
that prevent compliance in some cases.
Applications that depend on standards conformance might fail due to non-standard
behavior when checking file system free space.
<DT><B>volume</B>


<DD>
A logical volume exported as a raw or block device.
This type of dataset should only be used under special circumstances.
File systems are typically used in most environments.
<DT><B>snapshot</B>


<DD>
A read-only version of a file system or volume at a given point in time.
It is specified as
<I>filesystem </I><B>@ </B><I>name</I>







or
<I>volume </I><B>@ </B><I>name</I>







 
<DT><B>bookmark</B>


<DD>
Much like a
<B>snapshot</B>

 
but without the hold on on-disk data. It can be used as the source of a send
(but not for a receive). It is specified as
<I>filesystem </I><B># </B><I>name</I>







or
<I>volume </I><B># </B><I>name</I>







 
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>ZFS File System Hierarchy</H3>

A ZFS storage pool is a logical collection of devices that provide space for
datasets.
A storage pool is also the root of the ZFS file system hierarchy.
<P>

The root of the pool can be accessed as a file system, such as mounting and
unmounting, taking snapshots, and setting properties.
The physical storage characteristics, however, are managed by the
<A HREF="../man8/zpool.8.html">zpool</A>(8)


command.
<P>

See
<A HREF="../man8/zpool.8.html">zpool</A>(8)


for more information on creating and administering pools.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Snapshots</H3>

A snapshot is a read-only copy of a file system or volume.
Snapshots can be created extremely quickly, and initially consume no additional
space within the pool.
As data within the active dataset changes, the snapshot consumes more data than
would otherwise be shared with the active dataset.
<P>

Snapshots can have arbitrary names.
Snapshots of volumes can be cloned or rolled back, visibility is determined
by the
<B>snapdev</B>

property of the parent volume.
<P>

File system snapshots can be accessed under the
.zfs/snapshot

directory in the root of the file system.
Snapshots are automatically mounted on demand and may be unmounted at regular
intervals.
The visibility of the
.zfs

directory can be controlled by the
<B>snapdir</B>

property.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Bookmarks</H3>

A bookmark is like a snapshot, a read-only copy of a file system or volume.
Bookmarks can be created extremely quickly, compared to snapshots, and they
consume no additional space within the pool. Bookmarks can also have arbitrary
names, much like snapshots.
<P>

Unlike snapshots, bookmarks can not be accessed through the filesystem in any
way. From a storage standpoint a bookmark just provides a way to reference
when a snapshot was created as a distinct object. Bookmarks are initially
tied to a snapshot, not the filesystem or volume, and they will survive if the
snapshot itself is destroyed. Since they are very light weight there's little
incentive to destroy them.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Clones</H3>

A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial contents are the same
as another dataset.
As with snapshots, creating a clone is nearly instantaneous, and initially
consumes no additional space.
<P>

Clones can only be created from a snapshot.
When a snapshot is cloned, it creates an implicit dependency between the parent
and child.
Even though the clone is created somewhere else in the dataset hierarchy, the
original snapshot cannot be destroyed as long as a clone exists.
The
<B>origin</B>

property exposes this dependency, and the
<B>destroy</B>

command lists any such dependencies, if they exist.
<P>

The clone parent-child dependency relationship can be reversed by using the
<B>promote</B>

subcommand.
This causes the
Qq origin

file system to become a clone of the specified file system, which makes it
possible to destroy the file system that the clone was created from.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Mount Points</H3>

Creating a ZFS file system is a simple operation, so the number of file systems
per system is likely to be numerous.
To cope with this, ZFS automatically manages mounting and unmounting file
systems without the need to edit the
/etc/fstab

file.
All automatically managed file systems are mounted by ZFS at boot time.
<P>

By default, file systems are mounted under
/path

 
where
<I>path</I>

is the name of the file system in the ZFS namespace.
Directories are created and destroyed as needed.
<P>

A file system can also have a mount point set in the
<B>mountpoint</B>

property.
This directory is created as needed, and ZFS automatically mounts the file
system when the
<B>zfs mount -a</B>





command is invoked
Po without editing

/etc/fstab

Pc .

The
<B>mountpoint</B>

property can be inherited, so if
<I>pool/home</I>

has a mount point of
/export/stuff

 
then
<I>pool/home/user</I>

automatically inherits a mount point of
/export/stuff/user

 
<P>

A file system
<B>mountpoint</B>

property of
<B>none</B>

prevents the file system from being mounted.
<P>

If needed, ZFS file systems can also be managed with traditional tools
Po <B>mount</B>

 

<B>umount</B>

 
/etc/fstab

Pc .

If a file system's mount point is set to
<B>legacy</B>

 
ZFS makes no attempt to manage the file system, and the administrator is
responsible for mounting and unmounting the file system. Because pools must
be imported before a legacy mount can succeed, administrators should ensure
that legacy mounts are only attempted after the zpool import process
finishes at boot time. For example, on machines using systemd, the mount
option
<P>

<B>x-systemd.requires=zfs-import.target</B>

<P>

will ensure that the zfs-import completes before systemd attempts mounting
the filesystem. See <A HREF="../man5/systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount</A>(5) for details.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Deduplication</H3>

Deduplication is the process for removing redundant data at the block level,
reducing the total amount of data stored. If a file system has the
<B>dedup</B>

property enabled, duplicate data blocks are removed synchronously. The result
is that only unique data is stored and common components are shared among files.
<P>

Deduplicating data is a very resource-intensive operation. It is generally
recommended that you have at least 1.25 GiB of RAM per 1 TiB of storage when
you enable deduplication. Calculating the exact requirement depends heavily
on the type of data stored in the pool.
<P>

Enabling deduplication on an improperly-designed system can result in
performance issues (slow IO and administrative operations). It can potentially
lead to problems importing a pool due to memory exhaustion. Deduplication
can consume significant processing power (CPU) and memory as well as generate
additional disk IO.
<P>

Before creating a pool with deduplication enabled, ensure that you have planned
your hardware requirements appropriately and implemented appropriate recovery
practices, such as regular backups. As an alternative to deduplication
consider using
<B>compression=lz4</B>

 
as a less resource-intensive alternative.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Native Properties</H3>

Properties are divided into two types, native properties and user-defined
Po or

Qq user

Pc properties.

Native properties either export internal statistics or control ZFS behavior.
In addition, native properties are either editable or read-only.
User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but you can use them to annotate
datasets in a way that is meaningful in your environment.
For more information about user properties, see the
Sx User Properties

section, below.
<P>

Every dataset has a set of properties that export statistics about the dataset
as well as control various behaviors.
Properties are inherited from the parent unless overridden by the child.
Some properties apply only to certain types of datasets
(file systems, volumes, or snapshots)

 
<P>

The values of numeric properties can be specified using human-readable suffixes
Po for example,

<B>k</B>

 
<B>KB</B>

 
<B>M</B>

 
<B>Gb </B>,



and so forth, up to
<B>Z</B>

for zettabyte
Pc .

The following are all valid
(and equal)

specifications:
<B>1536M, 1.5g, 1.50GB</B>

 
<P>

The values of non-numeric properties are case sensitive and must be lowercase,
except for
<B>mountpoint</B>

 
<B>sharenfs</B>

 
and
<B>sharesmb</B>

 
<P>

The following native properties consist of read-only statistics about the
dataset.
These properties can be neither set, nor inherited.
Native properties apply to all dataset types unless otherwise noted.
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>available</B>


<DD>
The amount of space available to the dataset and all its children, assuming that
there is no other activity in the pool.
Because space is shared within a pool, availability can be limited by any number
of factors, including physical pool size, quotas, reservations, or other
datasets within the pool.
<P>

This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
<B>avail</B>

 
<DT><B>compressratio</B>


<DD>
For non-snapshots, the compression ratio achieved for the
<B>used</B>

space of this dataset, expressed as a multiplier.
The
<B>used</B>

property includes descendant datasets, and, for clones, does not include the
space shared with the origin snapshot.
For snapshots, the
<B>compressratio</B>

is the same as the
<B>refcompressratio</B>

property.
Compression can be turned on by running:
<B>zfs set compression = on </B><I>dataset</I>













 
The default value is
<B>off</B>

 
<DT><B>createtxg</B>


<DD>
The transaction group (txg) in which the dataset was created. Bookmarks have
the same
<B>createtxg</B>

as the snapshot they are initially tied to. This property is suitable for
ordering a list of snapshots, e.g. for incremental send and receive.
<DT><B>creation</B>


<DD>
The time this dataset was created.
<DT><B>clones</B>


<DD>
For snapshots, this property is a comma-separated list of filesystems or volumes
which are clones of this snapshot.
The clones'
<B>origin</B>

property is this snapshot.
If the
<B>clones</B>

property is not empty, then this snapshot can not be destroyed
Po even with the

-<B>r</B>

or
-<B>f</B>

options
Pc .

The roles of origin and clone can be swapped by promoting the clone with the
<B>zfs promote</B>



command.
<DT><B>defer_destroy</B>


<DD>
This property is
<B>on</B>

if the snapshot has been marked for deferred destroy by using the
<B>zfs destroy -d</B>





command.
Otherwise, the property is
<B>off</B>

 
<DT><B>filesystem_count</B>


<DD>
The total number of filesystems and volumes that exist under this location in
the dataset tree.
This value is only available when a
<B>filesystem_limit</B>

has been set somewhere in the tree under which the dataset resides.
<DT><B>guid</B>


<DD>
The 64 bit GUID of this dataset or bookmark which does not change over its
entire lifetime. When a snapshot is sent to another pool, the received
snapshot has the same GUID. Thus, the
<B>guid</B>

is suitable to identify a snapshot across pools.
<DT><B>logicalreferenced</B>


<DD>
The amount of space that is

The amount of data that is accessible by this dataset, which may or may not be
shared with other datasets in the pool.
When a snapshot or clone is created, it initially references the same amount of

<B>snapshot</B>

 
<DT><B>used</B>


<DD>
The amount of space consumed by this dataset and all its descendents.
This is the value that is checked against this dataset's quota and reservation.
The space used does not include this dataset's reservation, but does take into
account the reservations of any descendent datasets.
The amount of space that a dataset consumes from its parent, as well as the
amount of space that is freed if this dataset is recursively destroyed, is the
greater of its space used and its reservation.
<P>

The used space of a snapshot
Po see the

Sx Snapshots

section
Pc is space that is referenced exclusively by this snapshot.

If this snapshot is destroyed, the amount of
<B>used</B>

space will be freed.
Space that is shared by multiple snapshots isn't accounted for in this metric.
When a snapshot is destroyed, space that was previously shared with this
snapshot can become unique to snapshots adjacent to it, thus changing the used
space of those snapshots.
The used space of the latest snapshot can also be affected by changes in the
file system.
Note that the
<B>used</B>

space of a snapshot is a subset of the
<B>written</B>

space of the snapshot.
<P>

The amount of space used, available, or referenced does not take into account
pending changes.
Pending changes are generally accounted for within a few seconds.
Committing a change to a disk using

<DT><B>userobjused @ </B><I>user</I>








<DD>
The
<B>userobjused</B>

property is similar to
<B>userused</B>

but instead it counts the number of objects consumed by a user. This property
counts all objects allocated on behalf of the user, it may differ from the
results of system tools such as
<B>df -i</B>



 
<P>

When the property
<B>xattr=on</B>

is set on a file system additional objects will be created per-file to store
extended attributes. These additional objects are reflected in the
<B>userobjused</B>

<DD>
For volumes, specifies the block size of the volume.
The

The following native properties can be used to change the behavior of a ZFS
dataset.
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>
</B>

<B>aclinherit = discard | noallow | restricted | passthrough | passthrough-x</B>































<DD>

<DD>Controls how ACEs are inherited when files and directories are created.
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>discard</B>


<DD>
does not inherit any ACEs.
<DT><B>noallow</B>


<DD>
only inherits inheritable ACEs that specify
Qq deny

permissions.
<DT><B>restricted</B>


<DD>
default, removes the
<B>write_acl</B>

and
<B>write_owner</B>

permissions when the ACE is inherited.
<DT><B>passthrough</B>


<DD>
inherits all inheritable ACEs without any modifications.
<DT><B>passthrough-x</B>


<DD>
same meaning as
<B>passthrough</B>

 
except that the
<B>owner@</B>

 
<B>group@</B>

 
and
<B>everyone@</B>

ACEs inherit the execute permission only if the file creation mode also requests
the execute bit.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

When the property value is set to
<B>passthrough</B>

 
files are created with a mode determined by the inheritable ACEs.
If no inheritable ACEs exist that affect the mode, then the mode is set in
accordance to the requested mode from the application.
<P>

The
<B>aclinherit</B>

property does not apply to posix ACLs.
<DT><B>acltype = off | noacl | posixacl</B>




















<DD>
Controls whether ACLs are enabled and if so what type of ACL to use.
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>off</B>


<DD>
default, when a file system has the
<B>acltype</B>

property set to off then ACLs are disabled.
<DT><B>noacl</B>


<DD>
an alias for
<B>off</B>

<DT><B>posixacl</B>


<DD>
indicates posix ACLs should be used. Posix ACLs are specific to Linux and are
not functional on other platforms. Posix ACLs are stored as an extended
attribute and therefore will not overwrite any existing NFSv4 ACLs which
may be set.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

To obtain the best performance when setting
<B>posixacl</B>

users are strongly encouraged to set the
<B>xattr=sa</B>

property. This will result in the posix ACL being stored more efficiently on
disk. But as a consequence of this all new extended attributes will only be
accessible from OpenZFS implementations which support the
<B>xattr=sa</B>

property. See the
<B>xattr</B>

property for more details.
<DT><B>atime = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls whether the access time for files is updated when they are read.
Turning this property off avoids producing write traffic when reading files and
can result in significant performance gains, though it might confuse mailers
and other similar utilities. The values
<B>on</B>

and
<B>off</B>

are equivalent to the
<B>atime</B>

and
<B>noatime</B>

mount options. The default value is
<B>on</B>

 
See also
<B>relatime</B>

below.
<DT><B>canmount = on | off | noauto</B>




















<DD>
If this property is set to
<B>off</B>

 
the file system cannot be mounted, and is ignored by
<B>zfs mount -a</B>





 
Setting this property to
<B>off</B>

is similar to setting the
<B>mountpoint</B>

property to
<B>none</B>

 
except that the dataset still has a normal
<B>mountpoint</B>

property, which can be inherited.
Setting this property to
<B>off</B>

allows datasets to be used solely as a mechanism to inherit properties.
One example of setting
<B>canmount = off</B>







is to have two datasets with the same
<B>mountpoint</B>

 
so that the children of both datasets appear in the same directory, but might
have different inherited characteristics.
<P>

When set to
<B>noauto</B>

 
a dataset can only be mounted and unmounted explicitly.
The dataset is not mounted automatically when the dataset is created or
imported, nor is it mounted by the
<B>zfs mount -a</B>





command or unmounted by the
<B>zfs unmount -a</B>





command.
<P>

This property is not inherited.
<DT><B>
</B>

<B>checksum = on | off | fletcher2 | fletcher4 | sha256 | noparity | sha512 | skein | edonr</B>























































<DD>

<DD>Controls the checksum used to verify data integrity.
The default value is
<B>on</B>

 
which automatically selects an appropriate algorithm
Po currently,

<B>fletcher4</B>

 
but this may change in future releases
Pc .

The value
<B>off</B>

disables integrity checking on user data.
The value
<B>noparity</B>

not only disables integrity but also disables maintaining parity for user data.
This setting is used internally by a dump device residing on a RAID-Z pool and
should not be used by any other dataset.
Disabling checksums is
<B>NOT</B>

a recommended practice.
<P>

The
<B>sha512</B>

 
<B>skein</B>

 
and
<B>edonr</B>

checksum algorithms require enabling the appropriate features on the pool.
These algorithms are not supported by GRUB and should not be set on the
<B>bootfs</B>

filesystem when using GRUB to boot the system.
Please see
zpool-features5


for more information on these algorithms.
<P>

Changing this property affects only newly-written data.
<DT><B>

<B>compression = on | off | gzip | gzip- </B><I>N </I><B>| lz4 | lzjb | zle</B>















































<DD>

<DD>Controls the compression algorithm used for this dataset.
<P>

Setting compression to
<B>on</B>

indicates that the current default compression algorithm should be used.
The default balances compression and decompression speed, with compression ratio
and is expected to work well on a wide variety of workloads.
Unlike all other settings for this property,
<B>on</B>

does not select a fixed compression type.
As new compression algorithms are added to ZFS and enabled on a pool, the
default compression algorithm may change.
The current default compression algorithm is either
<B>lzjb</B>

or, if the
<B>lz4_compress</B>

feature is enabled,
<B>lz4</B>

 
<P>

The
<B>lz4</B>

compression algorithm is a high-performance replacement for the
<B>lzjb</B>

algorithm.
It features significantly faster compression and decompression, as well as a
moderately higher compression ratio than
<B>lzjb</B>

 
but can only be used on pools with the
<B>lz4_compress</B>

feature set to
<B>enabled</B>

 
See
zpool-features5


for details on ZFS feature flags and the
<B>lz4_compress</B>

feature.
<P>

The
<B>lzjb</B>

compression algorithm is optimized for performance while providing decent data
compression.
<P>

The
<B>gzip</B>

compression algorithm uses the same compression as the
<A HREF="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</A>(1)


command.
You can specify the
<B>gzip</B>

level by using the value
<B>gzip- </B><I>N</I>





 
where
<I>N</I>

is an integer from 1
(fastest)

to 9
(best compression ratio)

 
Currently,
<B>gzip</B>

is equivalent to
<B>gzip-6</B>

Po which is also the default for

<A HREF="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</A>(1)

<A HREF="../man8/selinux.8.html">selinux</A>(8)


for more information.
<DT><B>copies = 1 | 2 | 3</B>




















<DD>
Controls the number of copies of data stored for this dataset.
These copies are in addition to any redundancy provided by the pool, for
example, mirroring or RAID-Z.
The copies are stored on different disks, if possible.
The space used by multiple copies is charged to the associated file and dataset,
changing the
<B>used</B>

property and counting against quotas and reservations.
<P>

Changing this property only affects newly-written data.
Therefore, set this property at file system creation time by using the
-<B>o copies = </B><I>N</I>









option.
<P>

Remember that ZFS will not import a pool with a missing top-level vdev. Do
<B>NOT</B>

create, for example a two-disk striped pool and set
<B>copies=2</B>

on some datasets thinking you have setup redundancy for them. When a disk
fails you will not be able to import the pool and will have lost all of your
data.
<DT><B>devices = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls whether device nodes can be opened on this file system.
The default value is
<B>on</B>

 
The values
<B>on</B>

and
<B>off</B>

are equivalent to the
<B>dev</B>

and
<B>nodev</B>

mount options.
<DT><B>
</B>

<B>dnodesize = legacy | auto | 1k | 2k | 4k | 8k | 16k</B>











































<DD>

<DD>Specifies a compatibility mode or literal value for the size of dnodes in the
file system. The default value is
<B>legacy</B>

 
Setting this property to a value other than
<B>legacy</B>

requires the large_dnode pool feature to be enabled.
<P>

Consider setting
<B>dnodesize</B>

to
<B>auto</B>

if the dataset uses the
<B>xattr=sa</B>

property setting and the workload makes heavy use of extended attributes. This
may be applicable to SELinux-enabled systems, Lustre servers, and Samba
servers, for example. Literal values are supported for cases where the optimal
size is known in advance and for performance testing.
<P>

Leave
<B>dnodesize</B>

set to
<B>legacy</B>

if you need to receive a send stream of this dataset on a pool that doesn't
enable the large_dnode feature, or if you need to import this pool on a system
that doesn't support the large_dnode feature.
<P>

This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
<B>dnsize</B>

 
<DT><B>exec = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls whether processes can be executed from within this file system.
The default value is
<B>on</B>

 
The values
<B>on</B>

and
<B>off</B>

are equivalent to the
<B>exec</B>

and
<B>noexec</B>

mount options.
<DT><B>filesystem_limit = </B><I>count </I><B>| none</B>














<DD>
Limits the number of filesystems and volumes that can exist under this point in
the dataset tree.
The limit is not enforced if the user is allowed to change the limit.
Setting a
<B>filesystem_limit</B>

to
<B>on</B>

a descendent of a filesystem that already has a
<B>filesystem_limit</B>

does not override the ancestor's
<B>filesystem_limit</B>

 
but rather imposes an additional limit.
This feature must be enabled to be used

Pc .

<DT><B>mountpoint = path | none | legacy</B>




















<DD>
Controls the mount point used for this file system.
See the
Sx Mount Points

section for more information on how this property is used.
<P>

When the
<B>mountpoint</B>

property is changed for a file system, the file system and any children that
inherit the mount point are unmounted.
If the new value is
<B>legacy</B>

 
then they remain unmounted.
Otherwise, they are automatically remounted in the new location if the property
was previously
<B>legacy</B>

or
<B>none</B>

 
or if they were mounted before the property was changed.
In addition, any shared file systems are unshared and shared in the new
location.
<DT><B>nbmand = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls whether the file system should be mounted with
<B>nbmand</B>

(Non Blocking mandatory locks)

 
This is used for SMB clients.
Changes to this property only take effect when the file system is umounted and
remounted.
See
<A HREF="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</A>(8)


for more information on
<B>nbmand</B>

mounts. This property is not used on Linux.
<DT><B>overlay = off | on</B>














<DD>
Allow mounting on a busy directory or a directory which already contains
files or directories. This is the default mount behavior for Linux file systems.
For consistency with OpenZFS on other platforms overlay mounts are
<B>off</B>

by default. Set to
<B>on</B>

to enable overlay mounts.
<DT><B>primarycache = all | none | metadata</B>




















<DD>
Controls what is cached in the primary cache
(ARC)

 
If this property is set to
<B>all</B>

 
then both user data and metadata is cached.
If this property is set to
<B>none</B>

 
then neither user data nor metadata is cached.
If this property is set to
<B>metadata</B>

 
then only metadata is cached.
The default value is
<B>all</B>

 
<DT><B>quota = </B><I>size </I><B>| none</B>














<DD>
Limits the amount of space a dataset and its descendents can consume.
This property enforces a hard limit on the amount of space used.
This includes all space consumed by descendents, including file systems and
snapshots.
Setting a quota on a descendent of a dataset that already has a quota does not
override the ancestor's quota, but rather imposes an additional limit.
<P>

Quotas cannot be set on volumes, as the
<B>volsize</B>

property acts as an implicit quota.
<DT><B>snapshot_limit = </B><I>count </I><B>| none</B>

Limits the number of snapshots that can be created on a dataset and its
descendents.
Setting a
<B>snapshot_limit</B>

on a descendent of a dataset that already has a
<B>snapshot_limit</B>

does not override the ancestor's
<B>snapshot_limit</B>

 
but rather imposes an additional limit.
The limit is not enforced if the user is allowed to change the limit.
For example, this means that recursive snapshots taken from the global zone are
counted against each delegated dataset within a zone.

Limits the amount of space consumed by the specified user.
User space consumption is identified by the
<B>userspace@ </B><I>user</I>





property.
<P>

Enforcement of user quotas may be delayed by several seconds.
This delay means that a user might exceed their quota before the system notices

<DD>
Controls whether this dataset can be modified.
The default value is
<B>off</B>

 
The values
<B>on</B>

<P>

This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
<B>rdonly</B>

 
<DT><B>recordsize = </B><I>size</I>








<DD>
Specifies a suggested block size for files in the file system.
This property is designed solely for use with database workloads that access
files in fixed-size records.
ZFS automatically tunes block sizes according to internal algorithms optimized
for typical access patterns.
<P>

For databases that create very large files but access them in small random
chunks, these algorithms may be suboptimal.
Specifying a
<B>recordsize</B>

greater than or equal to the record size of the database can result in
significant performance gains.
Use of this property for general purpose file systems is strongly discouraged,
and may adversely affect performance.
<P>

The size specified must be a power of two greater than or equal to 512 and less
than or equal to 128 Kbytes.
If the
<B>large_blocks</B>

feature is enabled on the pool, the size may be up to 1 Mbyte.
See

for details on ZFS feature flags.
<P>

Changing the file system's
<B>recordsize</B>

affects only files created afterward; existing files are unaffected.
<P>

This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
<B>recsize</B>

 
<DT><B>redundant_metadata = all | most</B>














<DD>
Controls what types of metadata are stored redundantly.
ZFS stores an extra copy of metadata, so that if a single block is corrupted,
the amount of user data lost is limited.
This extra copy is in addition to any redundancy provided at the pool level
(e.g. by mirroring or RAID-Z)

 
and is in addition to an extra copy specified by the
<B>copies</B>

property
(up to a total of 3 copies)

 
For example if the pool is mirrored,
<B>copies = 2</B>





 
and
<B>redundant_metadata = most</B>







 
then ZFS stores 6 copies of most metadata, and 4 copies of data and some
metadata.
<P>

When set to
<B>all</B>

 
ZFS stores an extra copy of all metadata.
If a single on-disk block is corrupt, at worst a single block of user data
Po which is

<B>recordsize</B>

bytes long
Pc can be lost.

<P>

When set to
<B>most</B>

 
ZFS stores an extra copy of most types of metadata.
This can improve performance of random writes, because less metadata must be
written.
In practice, at worst about 100 blocks
Po of

<B>recordsize</B>

bytes each
Pc of user data can be lost if a single on-disk block is corrupt.

The exact behavior of which metadata blocks are stored redundantly may change in
future releases.
<P>

The default value is
<B>all</B>

 
<DT><B>refquota = </B><I>size </I><B>| none</B>














<DD>
Limits the amount of space a dataset can consume.
This property enforces a hard limit on the amount of space used.
This hard limit does not include space used by descendents, including file
systems and snapshots.
<DT><B>refreservation = </B><I>size </I><B>| none</B>














<DD>
The minimum amount of space guaranteed to a dataset, not including its
descendents.
When the amount of space used is below this value, the dataset is treated as if
it were taking up the amount of space specified by
<B>refreservation</B>

 
The
<B>refreservation</B>

reservation is accounted for in the parent datasets' space used, and counts
against the parent datasets' quotas and reservations.
<P>

If
<B>refreservation</B>

is set, a snapshot is only allowed if there is enough free pool space outside of
this reservation to accommodate the current number of
Qq referenced

bytes in the dataset.
<P>

This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
<B>refreserv</B>

 
<DT><B>relatime = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls the manner in which the access time is updated when
<B>atime=on</B>

is set. Turning this property on causes the access time to be updated relative
to the modify or change time. Access time is only updated if the previous
access time was earlier than the current modify or change time or if the
existing access time hasn't been updated within the past 24 hours. The default
value is
<B>off</B>

 
The values
<B>on</B>

and
<B>off</B>

are equivalent to the
<B>relatime</B>

and
<B>norelatime</B>

mount options.
<DT><B>reservation = </B><I>size </I><B>| none</B>














<DD>
The minimum amount of space guaranteed to a dataset and its descendants.
When the amount of space used is below this value, the dataset is treated as if
it were taking up the amount of space specified by its reservation.
Reservations are accounted for in the parent datasets' space used, and count
against the parent datasets' quotas and reservations.
<P>

This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
<B>reserv</B>

 
<DT><B>secondarycache = all | none | metadata</B>




















<DD>
Controls what is cached in the secondary cache
(L2ARC)

 
If this property is set to
<B>all</B>

 
then both user data and metadata is cached.
If this property is set to
<B>none</B>

 
then neither user data nor metadata is cached.
If this property is set to
<B>metadata</B>

 
then only metadata is cached.
The default value is
<B>all</B>

 
<DT><B>setuid = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls whether the setuid bit is respected for the file system.
The default value is
<B>on</B>

 
The values
<B>on</B>

and
<B>off</B>

are equivalent to the
<B>suid</B>

and
<B>nosuid</B>

mount options.
<DT><B>sharesmb = on | off | </B><I>opts</I>




















<DD>
Controls whether the file system is shared by using
<B>Samba USERSHARES</B>

and what options are to be used. Otherwise, the file system is automatically
shared and unshared with the
<B>zfs share</B>



and
<B>zfs unshare</B>



commands. If the property is set to on, the
<A HREF="../man8/net.8.html">net</A>(8)


command is invoked to create a
<B>USERSHARE</B>

 
<P>

Because SMB shares requires a resource name, a unique resource name is
constructed from the dataset name. The constructed name is a copy of the
dataset name except that the characters in the dataset name, which would be
invalid in the resource name, are replaced with underscore (_) characters.
Linux does not currently support additional options which might be available
on Solaris.
<P>

If the
<B>sharesmb</B>

property is set to
<B>off</B>

 
the file systems are unshared.
<P>

The share is created with the ACL (Access Control List) &quot;Everyone:F&quot; (&quot;F&quot;
stands for &quot;full permissions&quot;, ie. read and write permissions) and no guest
access (which means Samba must be able to authenticate a real user, system
passwd/shadow, LDAP or smbpasswd based) by default. This means that any
additional access control (disallow specific user specific access etc) must
be done on the underlying file system.
<DT><B>sharenfs = on | off | </B><I>opts</I>




















<DD>
Controls whether the file system is shared via NFS, and what options are to be
used.
A file system with a
<B>sharenfs</B>

property of
<B>off</B>

is managed with the
<A HREF="../man8/exportfs.8.html">exportfs</A>(8)


command and entries in the
<I>/etc/exports</I>

file.
Otherwise, the file system is automatically shared and unshared with the
<B>zfs share</B>



and
<B>zfs unshare</B>



commands.
If the property is set to
<B>on</B>

 
the dataset is shared using the default options:
<P>

<I>sec=sys,rw,crossmnt,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash</I>

<P>

See
<A HREF="../man5/exports.5.html">exports</A>(5)


for the meaning of the default options. Otherwise, the
<A HREF="../man8/exportfs.8.html">exportfs</A>(8)


command is invoked with options equivalent to the contents of this property.
<P>

When the
<B>sharenfs</B>

property is changed for a dataset, the dataset and any children inheriting the
property are re-shared with the new options, only if the property was previously
<B>off</B>

 
or if they were shared before the property was changed.
If the new property is
<B>off</B>

 
the file systems are unshared.
<DT><B>logbias = latency | throughput</B>














<DD>
Provide a hint to ZFS about handling of synchronous requests in this dataset.
If
<B>logbias</B>

is set to
<B>latency</B>

(the default)

 
ZFS will use pool log devices
(if configured)

to handle the requests at low latency.
If
<B>logbias</B>

is set to
<B>throughput</B>

 
ZFS will not use configured pool log devices.
ZFS will instead optimize synchronous operations for global pool throughput and
efficient use of resources.
<DT><B>snapdev = hidden | visible</B>














<DD>
Controls whether the volume snapshot devices under
<I>/dev/zvol/&lt;pool&gt;</I>

are hidden or visible. The default value is
<B>hidden</B>

 
<DT><B>snapdir = hidden | visible</B>














<DD>
Controls whether the
.zfs

directory is hidden or visible in the root of the file system as discussed in
the
Sx Snapshots

section.
The default value is
<B>hidden</B>

 
<DT><B>sync = standard | always | disabled</B>




















<DD>
Controls the behavior of synchronous requests
(e.g. fsync, O_DSYNC)

 
<B>standard</B>

is the
<B>POSIX</B>

specified behavior of ensuring all synchronous requests are written to stable
storage and all devices are flushed to ensure data is not cached by device
controllers
(this is the default)

 
<B>always</B>

causes every file system transaction to be written and flushed before its
system call returns.
This has a large performance penalty.
<B>disabled</B>

disables synchronous requests.
File system transactions are only committed to stable storage periodically.
This option will give the highest performance.
However, it is very dangerous as ZFS would be ignoring the synchronous
transaction demands of applications such as databases or NFS.
Administrators should only use this option when the risks are understood.
<DT><B>version = </B><I>N </I><B>| current</B>














<DD>
The on-disk version of this file system, which is independent of the pool
version.
This property can only be set to later supported versions.
See the
<B>zfs upgrade</B>



command.
<DT><B>volsize = </B><I>size</I>








<DD>
For volumes, specifies the logical size of the volume.
By default, creating a volume establishes a reservation of equal size.
For storage pools with a version number of 9 or higher, a
<B>refreservation</B>

is set instead.
Any changes to
<B>volsize</B>

are reflected in an equivalent change to the reservation
Po or

<B>refreservation</B>

Pc .

The
<B>volsize</B>

can only be set to a multiple of
<B>volblocksize</B>

 
and cannot be zero.
<P>

The reservation is kept equal to the volume's logical size to prevent unexpected
behavior for consumers.
Without the reservation, the volume could run out of space, resulting in
undefined behavior or data corruption, depending on how the volume is used.
These effects can also occur when the volume size is changed while it is in use
(particularly when shrinking the size)

 
Extreme care should be used when adjusting the volume size.
<P>

Though not recommended, a
Qq sparse volume

Po also known as

Qq thin provisioning

Pc can be created by specifying the

-<B>s</B>

option to the
<B>zfs create -V</B>





command, or by changing the reservation after the volume has been created.
A
Qq sparse volume

is a volume where the reservation is less then the volume size.
Consequently, writes to a sparse volume can fail with
Er ENOSPC

when the pool is low on space.
For a sparse volume, changes to
<B>volsize</B>

are not reflected in the reservation.
<DT><B>volmode = default | full | geom | dev | none</B>








<DD>
This property specifies how volumes should be exposed to the OS.
Setting it to
<B>full</B>

exposes volumes as fully fledged block devices, providing maximal
functionality. The value
<B>geom</B>

is just an alias for
<B>full</B>

and is kept for compatibility.
Setting it to
<B>dev</B>

hides its partitions.
Volumes with property set to
<B>none</B>

are not exposed outside ZFS, but can be snapshoted, cloned, replicated, etc,
that can be suitable for backup purposes.
Value
<B>default</B>

means that volumes exposition is controlled by system-wide tunable
<I>zvol_volmode</I>

 
where
<B>full</B>

 
<B>dev</B>

and
<B>none</B>

are encoded as 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
The default values is
<B>full</B>

 
<DT><B>vscan = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls whether regular files should be scanned for viruses when a file is
opened and closed.
In addition to enabling this property, the virus scan service must also be
enabled for virus scanning to occur.
The default value is
<B>off</B>

 
This property is not used on Linux.
<DT><B>xattr = on | off | sa</B>




















<DD>
Controls whether extended attributes are enabled for this file system. Two
styles of extended attributes are supported either directory based or system
attribute based.
<P>

The default value of
<B>on</B>

enables directory based extended attributes. This style of extended attribute
imposes no practical limit on either the size or number of attributes which
can be set on a file. Although under Linux the
<A HREF="../man2/getxattr.2.html">getxattr</A>(2)


and
<A HREF="../man2/setxattr.2.html">setxattr</A>(2)


system calls limit the maximum size to 64K. This is the most compatible
style of extended attribute and is supported by all OpenZFS implementations.
<P>

System attribute based xattrs can be enabled by setting the value to
<B>sa</B>

 
The key advantage of this type of xattr is improved performance. Storing
extended attributes as system attributes significantly decreases the amount of
disk IO required. Up to 64K of data may be stored per-file in the space
reserved for system attributes. If there is not enough space available for
an extended attribute then it will be automatically written as a directory
based xattr. System attribute based extended attributes are not accessible
on platforms which do not support the
<B>xattr=sa</B>

feature.
<P>

The use of system attribute based xattrs is strongly encouraged for users of
SELinux or posix ACLs. Both of these features heavily rely of extended
attributes and benefit significantly from the reduced access time.
<P>

The values
<B>on</B>

and
<B>off</B>

are equivalent to the
<B>xattr</B>

and
<B>noxattr</B>

mount options.
<DT><B>zoned = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls whether the dataset is managed from a non-global zone. Zones are a
Solaris feature and are not relevant on Linux. The default value is
<B>off</B>

 
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The following three properties cannot be changed after the file system is
created, and therefore, should be set when the file system is created.
If the properties are not set with the
<B>zfs create</B>



or
<B>zpool create</B>



commands, these properties are inherited from the parent dataset.
If the parent dataset lacks these properties due to having been created prior to
these features being supported, the new file system will have the default values
for these properties.
<DL COMPACT>

<B>casesensitivity = sensitive | insensitive | mixed</B>



















<DD>

<DD>Indicates whether the file name matching algorithm used by the file system
should be case-sensitive, case-insensitive, or allow a combination of both
styles of matching.
The default value for the
<B>casesensitivity</B>

property is
<B>sensitive</B>

 
Traditionally,
UNIX
and
<B>POSIX</B>

file systems have case-sensitive file names.
<P>

The
<B>mixed</B>

value for the
<B>casesensitivity</B>

property indicates that the file system can support requests for both
case-sensitive and case-insensitive matching behavior.
Currently, case-insensitive matching behavior on a file system that supports
mixed behavior is limited to the SMB server product.
For more information about the
<B>mixed</B>

value behavior, see the &quot;ZFS Administration Guide&quot;.
<DT><B>
</B>

<B>normalization = none | formC | formD | formKC | formKD</B>































<DD>

<DD>Indicates whether the file system should perform a

normalization of file names whenever two file names are compared, and which
normalization algorithm should be used.
File names are always stored unmodified, names are normalized as part of any
comparison process.
If this property is set to a legal value other than
<B>none</B>

 
and the
<B>utf8only</B>

property was left unspecified, the
<B>utf8only</B>

property is automatically set to
<B>on</B>

 
The default value of the
<B>normalization</B>

property is
<B>none</B>

 
This property cannot be changed after the file system is created.
<DT><B>utf8only = on | off</B>














<DD>
Indicates whether the file system should reject file names that include
characters that are not present in the
<B>UTF-8</B>

character code set.
If this property is explicitly set to
<B>off</B>

 
the normalization property must either not be explicitly set or be set to
<B>none</B>

 
The default value for the

property is
<B>off</B>

 
This property cannot be changed after the file system is created.

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Temporary Mount Point Properties</H3>

When a file system is mounted, either through
<A HREF="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</A>(8)


for legacy mounts or the
<B>zfs mount</B>



command for normal file systems, its mount options are set according to its
properties.
The correlation between properties and mount options is as follows:

<PRE>
    PROPERTY                MOUNT OPTION
    atime                   atime/noatime
    canmount                auto/noauto
    devices                 dev/nodev

    setuid                  suid/nosuid
    xattr                   xattr/noxattr
</PRE>

<P>

In addition, these options can be set on a per-mount basis using the
-<B>o</B>

option, without affecting the property that is stored on disk.
The values specified on the command line override the values stored in the
dataset.
The
<B>nosuid</B>

option is an alias for
<B>nodevices , nosetuid</B>







 
These properties are reported as
Qq temporary

by the
<B>zfs get</B>



command.
If the properties are changed while the dataset is mounted, the new setting
overrides any temporary settings.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>User Properties</H3>

In addition to the standard native properties, ZFS supports arbitrary user
properties.
User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but applications or
administrators can use them to annotate datasets
(file systems, volumes, and snapshots)

 
<P>

User property names must contain a colon
(Qq <B>:</B>



)

character to distinguish them from native properties.
They may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctuation
characters: colon
(Qq <B>:</B>



)

 
dash
(Qq <B>-</B>



)

 
period
(Qq <B>.</B>



)

 
and underscore
(Qq <B>_</B>



)

 
The expected convention is that the property name is divided into two portions
such as
<I>module </I><B>: </B><I>property</I>







 
but this namespace is not enforced by ZFS.
User property names can be at most 256 characters, and cannot begin with a dash
(Qq <B>-</B>



)

 
<P>

When making programmatic use of user properties, it is strongly suggested to use
a reversed
<B>DNS</B>

domain name for the
<I>module</I>

component of property names to reduce the chance that two
independently-developed packages use the same property name for different
purposes.
<P>

The values of user properties are arbitrary strings, are always inherited, and
are never validated.
All of the commands that operate on properties
Po Nm zfs Cm list ,

<B>zfs get</B>



 
<B>zfs set</B>



 
and so forth
Pc can be used to manipulate both native properties and user properties.

Use the
<B>zfs inherit</B>



command to clear a user property.
If the property is not defined in any parent dataset, it is removed entirely.
Property values are limited to 8192 bytes.

<DD>

<DD>Creates a snapshot whose contents are as specified in the stream provided on
standard input.
If a full stream is received, then a new file system is created as well.
Streams are created using the
<B>zfs send</B>



subcommand, which by default creates a full stream.
<B>zfs recv</B>



can be used as an alias for
<B>zfs receive.</B>



<P>

If an incremental stream is received, then the destination file system must
already exist, and its most recent snapshot must match the incremental stream's
source.
For
<B>zvols</B>

 
the destination device link is destroyed and recreated, which means the
<B>zvol</B>

cannot be accessed during the
<B>receive</B>

operation.
<P>

When a snapshot replication package stream that is generated by using the
<B>zfs send -R</B>





command is received, any snapshots that do not exist on the sending location are
destroyed by using the
<B>zfs destroy -d</B>





command.
<P>

If
<B>-o </B><I>property=value</I>





or
<B>-x </B><I>property</I>





is specified, it applies to the effective value of the property throughout
the entire subtree of replicated datasets. Effective property values will be
set (
-<B>o</B>

) or inherited (
-<B>x</B>

) on the topmost in the replicated subtree. In descendant datasets, if the
property is set by the send stream, it will be overridden by forcing the
property to be inherited from the top‐most file system. Received properties
are retained in spite of being overridden and may be restored with
<B>zfs inherit -S</B>





 
Specifying
<B>-o </B><I>origin=snapshot</I>





is a special case because, even if
<B>origin</B>

is a read-only property and cannot be set, it's allowed to receive the send
stream as a clone of the given snapshot.
<P>

The name of the snapshot
(and file system, if a full stream is received)

that this subcommand creates depends on the argument type and the use of the
-<B>d</B>

or
-<B>e</B>

options.
<P>

If the argument is a snapshot name, the specified
<I>snapshot</I>

is created.
If the argument is a file system or volume name, a snapshot with the same name
as the sent snapshot is created within the specified
<I>filesystem</I>

or
<I>volume</I>

 
If neither of the
-<B>d</B>

or
-<B>e</B>

options are specified, the provided target snapshot name is used exactly as
provided.
<P>

The
-<B>d</B>

and
-<B>e</B>

options cause the file system name of the target snapshot to be determined by
appending a portion of the sent snapshot's name to the specified target
<I>filesystem</I>

 
If the
-<B>d</B>

option is specified, all but the first element of the sent snapshot's file
system path
(usually the pool name)

is used and any required intermediate file systems within the specified one are
created.
If the
-<B>e</B>

option is specified, then only the last element of the sent snapshot's file
system name
(i.e. the name of the source file system itself)

is used as the target file system name.

---- Permissions on tank/cindys --------------------------------------
Local+Descendent permissions:
        user cindys create,destroy,mount,snapshot
</PRE>

<P>

Because the
<I>tank/cindys</I>

mount point permission is set to 755 by default, user
<B>cindys</B>

will be unable to mount file systems under
<I>tank/cindys</I>

 
Add an ACE similar to the following syntax to provide mount point access:

<PRE>
# chmod A+user:cindys:add_subdirectory:allow /tank/cindys
</PRE>

<DD>
The following example shows how to see what has changed between a prior
snapshot of a ZFS dataset and its current state.
The
-<B>F</B>

option is used to indicate type information for the files affected.

<PRE>
# zfs diff -F tank/test@before tank/test
M       /       /tank/test/
M       F       /tank/test/linked      (+1)
R       F       /tank/test/oldname -&gt; /tank/test/newname
-       F       /tank/test/deleted
+       F       /tank/test/created
M       F       /tank/test/modified
</PRE>

# zfs bookmark rpool@snapshot rpool#bookmark
</PRE>

<DT><B>Example 24 Setting sharesmb Property Options on a ZFS File System</B>




<DD>
The following example show how to share SMB filesystem through ZFS. Note that
that a user and his/her password must be given.

<PRE>
# smbmount //127.0.0.1/share_tmp /mnt/tmp \
  -o user=workgroup/turbo,password=obrut,uid=1000
</PRE>

<P>

Minimal
<I>/etc/samba/smb.conf</I>

configuration required:
<P>

Samba will need to listen to 'localhost' (127.0.0.1) for the ZFS utilities to
communicate with Samba. This is the default behavior for most Linux
distributions.
<P>

Samba must be able to authenticate a user. This can be done in a number of
ways, depending on if using the system password file, LDAP or the Samba
specific smbpasswd file. How to do this is outside the scope of this manual.
Please refer to the
smb.conf5


man page for more information.
<P>

See the
<B>USERSHARE section</B>

of the
smb.conf5


man page for all configuration options in case you need to modify any options
to the share afterwards. Do note that any changes done with the
<A HREF="../man8/net.8.html">net</A>(8)


command will be undone if the share is ever unshared (such as at a reboot etc).
