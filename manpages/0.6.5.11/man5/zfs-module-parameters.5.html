Multiplication factor used to estimate actual disk consumption from the
size of data being written. The default value is a worst case estimate,

may wish to specify a more realistic inflation factor, particularly if
they operate close to quota or capacity limits.
<P>
Default value: 24
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spa_load_verify_data</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Whether to traverse data blocks during an &quot;extreme rewind&quot; (<B>-X</B>)
import.  Use 0 to disable and 1 to enable.
<P>
An extreme rewind import normally performs a full traversal of all
blocks in the pool for verification.  If this parameter is set to 0,
the traversal skips non-metadata blocks.  It can be toggled once the

<P>
Default value: 1
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spa_load_verify_metadata</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Whether to traverse blocks during an &quot;extreme rewind&quot; (<B>-X</B>)
pool import.  Use 0 to disable and 1 to enable.

the traversal is not performed.  It can be toggled once the import has
started to stop or start the traversal.
<P>
Default value: 1
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spa_load_verify_maxinflight</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

rewind&quot; (<B>-X</B>) pool import.
<P>
Default value: 10000
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spa_slop_shift</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Normally, we don't allow the last 3.2% (1/(2^spa_slop_shift)) of space
in the pool to be consumed.  This ensures that we don't run the pool
completely out of space, due to unaccounted changes (e.g. to the MOS).
It also limits the worst-case time to allocate space.  If we have
less than this amount of free space, most ZPL operations (e.g. write,
create) will return ENOSPC.
<P>
Default value: 5
</DL>

<P>

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_arc_average_blocksize</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The ARC's buffer hash table is sized based on the assumption of an average
block size of <B>zfs_arc_average_blocksize</B> (default 8K).  This works out
to roughly 1MB of hash table per 1GB of physical memory with 8-byte pointers.
For configurations with a known larger average block size this value can be
increased to reduce the memory footprint.
<P>
<P>
Default value: <B>8192</B>.

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_arc_evict_batch_limit</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_arc_meta_limit</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The maximum allowed size in bytes that meta data buffers are allowed to
consume in the ARC.  When this limit is reached meta data buffers will
be reclaimed even if the overall arc_c_max has not been reached.  This
value defaults to 0 which indicates that 3/4 of the ARC may be used
for meta data.
<P>

<P>


<B>zfs_arc_meta_prune</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The number of dentries and inodes to be scanned looking for entries
which can be dropped.  This may be required when the ARC reaches the
<B>zfs_arc_meta_limit</B> because dentries and inodes can pin buffers
in the ARC.  Increasing this value will cause to dentry and inode caches
to be pruned more aggressively.  Setting this value to 0 will disable
pruning the inode and dentry caches.

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_arc_overflow_shift</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The ARC size is considered to be overflowing if it exceeds the current
ARC target size (arc_c) by a threshold determined by this parameter.
The threshold is calculated as a fraction of arc_c using the formula
&quot;arc_c &gt;&gt; <B>zfs_arc_overflow_shift</B>&quot;.
<P>
The default value of 8 causes the ARC to be considered to be overflowing
if it exceeds the target size by 1/256th (0.3%) of the target size.
<P>
When the ARC is overflowing, new buffer allocations are stalled until
the reclaim thread catches up and the overflow condition no longer exists.
<P>
Default value: <B>8</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<P>
<B>zfs_arc_p_min_shift</B> (int)

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_dbgmsg_enable</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Internally ZFS keeps a small log to facilitate debugging.  By default the log
is disabled, to enable it set this option to 1.  The contents of the log can
be accessed by reading the /proc/spl/kstat/zfs/dbgmsg file.  Writing 0 to
this proc file clears the log.

<B>zfs_free_leak_on_eio</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
If destroy encounters an EIO while reading metadata (e.g. indirect
blocks), space referenced by the missing metadata can not be freed.
Normally this causes the background destroy to become &quot;stalled&quot;, as
it is unable to make forward progress.  While in this stalled state,
all remaining space to free from the error-encountering filesystem is
&quot;temporarily leaked&quot;.  Set this flag to cause it to ignore the EIO,
permanently leak the space from indirect blocks that can not be read,
and continue to free everything else that it can.
<P>
The default, &quot;stalling&quot; behavior is useful if the storage partially
fails (i.e. some but not all i/os fail), and then later recovers.  In
this case, we will be able to continue pool operations while it is
partially failed, and when it recovers, we can continue to free the
space, with no leaks.  However, note that this case is actually
fairly rare.
<P>
Typically pools either (a) fail completely (but perhaps temporarily,
e.g. a top-level vdev going offline), or (b) have localized,
permanent errors (e.g. disk returns the wrong data due to bit flip or
firmware bug).  In case (a), this setting does not matter because the
pool will be suspended and the sync thread will not be able to make
forward progress regardless.  In case (b), because the error is
permanent, the best we can do is leak the minimum amount of space,
which is what setting this flag will do.  Therefore, it is reasonable
for this flag to normally be set, but we chose the more conservative
approach of not setting it, so that there is no possibility of
leaking space in the &quot;partial temporary&quot; failure case.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
We currently support block sizes from 512 bytes to 16MB.  The benefits of
larger blocks, and thus larger IO, need to be weighed against the cost of
COWing a giant block to modify one byte.  Additionally, very large blocks
can have an impact on i/o latency, and also potentially on the memory
allocator.  Therefore, we do not allow the recordsize to be set larger than
zfs_max_recordsize (default 1MB).  Larger blocks can be created by changing
this tunable, and pools with larger blocks can always be imported and used,

Defines a threshold at which metaslab groups should be eligible for
allocations.  The value is expressed as a percentage of free space
beyond which a metaslab group is always eligible for allocations.
If a metaslab group's free space is less than or equal to the
the threshold, the allocator will avoid allocating to that group
unless all groups in the pool have reached the threshold.  Once all
groups have reached the threshold, all groups are allowed to accept
allocations.  The default value of 0 disables the feature and causes
all metaslab groups to be eligible for allocations.
<P>
This parameter allows to deal with pools having heavily imbalanced
vdevs such as would be the case when a new vdev has been added.
Setting the threshold to a non-zero percentage will stop allocations
from being made to vdevs that aren't filled to the specified percentage

<H2>ZFS I/O SCHEDULER</H2>

ZFS issues I/O operations to leaf vdevs to satisfy and complete I/Os.
The I/O scheduler determines when and in what order those operations are
issued.  The I/O scheduler divides operations into five I/O classes
prioritized in the following order: sync read, sync write, async read,
async write, and scrub/resilver.  Each queue defines the minimum and
maximum number of concurrent operations that may be issued to the
device.  In addition, the device has an aggregate maximum,
<B>zfs_vdev_max_active</B>. Note that the sum of the per-queue minimums
must not exceed the aggregate maximum.  If the sum of the per-queue
maximums exceeds the aggregate maximum, then the number of active I/Os
may reach <B>zfs_vdev_max_active</B>, in which case no further I/Os will
be issued regardless of whether all per-queue minimums have been met.
<P>
For many physical devices, throughput increases with the number of
concurrent operations, but latency typically suffers. Further, physical
devices typically have a limit at which more concurrent operations have no
effect on throughput or can actually cause it to decrease.
<P>
The scheduler selects the next operation to issue by first looking for an
I/O class whose minimum has not been satisfied. Once all are satisfied and
the aggregate maximum has not been hit, the scheduler looks for classes
whose maximum has not been satisfied. Iteration through the I/O classes is
done in the order specified above. No further operations are issued if the
aggregate maximum number of concurrent operations has been hit or if there
are no operations queued for an I/O class that has not hit its maximum.
Every time an I/O is queued or an operation completes, the I/O scheduler
looks for new operations to issue.
<P>
In general, smaller max_active's will lead to lower latency of synchronous
operations.  Larger max_active's may lead to higher overall throughput,
depending on underlying storage.
<P>
The ratio of the queues' max_actives determines the balance of performance
between reads, writes, and scrubs.  E.g., increasing
<B>zfs_vdev_scrub_max_active</B> will cause the scrub or resilver to complete
more quickly, but reads and writes to have higher latency and lower throughput.
<P>
All I/O classes have a fixed maximum number of outstanding operations
except for the async write class. Asynchronous writes represent the data
that is committed to stable storage during the syncing stage for
transaction groups. Transaction groups enter the syncing state
periodically so the number of queued async writes will quickly burst up
and then bleed down to zero. Rather than servicing them as quickly as
possible, the I/O scheduler changes the maximum number of active async
write I/Os according to the amount of dirty data in the pool.  Since
both throughput and latency typically increase with the number of
concurrent operations issued to physical devices, reducing the
burstiness in the number of concurrent operations also stabilizes the
response time of operations from other -- and in particular synchronous
-- queues. In broad strokes, the I/O scheduler will issue more
concurrent operations from the async write queue as there's more dirty
data in the pool.
<P>
Async Writes
<P>
The number of concurrent operations issued for the async write I/O class
follows a piece-wise linear function defined by a few adjustable points.

               `--------- zfs_vdev_async_write_active_min_dirty_percent

</PRE>

Until the amount of dirty data exceeds a minimum percentage of the dirty
data allowed in the pool, the I/O scheduler will limit the number of
concurrent operations to the minimum. As that threshold is crossed, the
number of concurrent operations issued increases linearly to the maximum at
the specified maximum percentage of the dirty data allowed in the pool.
<P>
Ideally, the amount of dirty data on a busy pool will stay in the sloped
part of the function between <B>zfs_vdev_async_write_active_min_dirty_percent</B>
and <B>zfs_vdev_async_write_active_max_dirty_percent</B>. If it exceeds the
maximum percentage, this indicates that the rate of incoming data is
greater than the rate that the backend storage can handle. In this case, we

<H2>ZFS TRANSACTION DELAY</H2>

We delay transactions when we've determined that the backend storage
isn't able to accommodate the rate of incoming writes.
<P>
If there is already a transaction waiting, we delay relative to when
that transaction will finish waiting.  This way the calculated delay time
is independent of the number of threads concurrently executing
transactions.
<P>
If we are the only waiter, wait relative to when the transaction
started, rather than the current time.  This credits the transaction for
&quot;time already served&quot;, e.g. reading indirect blocks.
<P>
The minimum time for a transaction to take is calculated as:
<PRE>
    min_time = zfs_delay_scale * (dirty - min) / (max - dirty)
    min_time is then capped at 100 milliseconds.
</PRE>

<P>
The delay has two degrees of freedom that can be adjusted via tunables.  The
percentage of dirty data at which we start to delay is defined by
<B>zfs_delay_min_dirty_percent</B>. This should typically be at or above
<B>zfs_vdev_async_write_active_max_dirty_percent</B> so that we only start to
delay after writing at full speed has failed to keep up with the incoming write
rate. The scale of the curve is defined by <B>zfs_delay_scale</B>. Roughly speaking,
this variable determines the amount of delay at the midpoint of the curve.

<P>
Note that since the delay is added to the outstanding time remaining on the
most recent transaction, the delay is effectively the inverse of IOPS.
Here the midpoint of 500us translates to 2000 IOPS. The shape of the curve
was chosen such that small changes in the amount of accumulated dirty data
in the first 3/4 of the curve yield relatively small differences in the
amount of delay.
<P>
The effects can be easier to understand when the amount of delay is
represented on a log scale:

</PRE>

<P>
Note here that only as the amount of dirty data approaches its limit does
the delay start to increase rapidly. The goal of a properly tuned system
should be to keep the amount of dirty data out of that range by first
ensuring that the appropriate limits are set for the I/O scheduler to reach
optimal throughput on the backend storage, and then by changing the value
of <B>zfs_delay_scale</B> to increase the steepness of the curve.
