<B>dbuf_cache_max_bytes</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Maximum size in bytes of the dbuf cache.  The target size is determined by the
MIN versus <B>1/2^dbuf_cache_shift</B> (1/32) of the target ARC size.  The
behavior of the dbuf cache and its associated settings can be observed via the
<B>/proc/spl/kstat/zfs/dbufstats</B> kstat.

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>dbuf_metadata_cache_max_bytes</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Maximum size in bytes of the metadata dbuf cache.  The target size is
determined by the MIN versus <B>1/2^dbuf_metadata_cache_shift</B> (1/64) of the
target ARC size.  The behavior of the metadata dbuf cache and its associated
settings can be observed via the <B>/proc/spl/kstat/zfs/dbufstats</B> kstat.

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>dmu_prefetch_max</B> (int)

</DL>

<P>
<P>

This is an alias for <B>send_holes_without_birth_time</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>

<B>l2arc_headroom</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
How far through the ARC lists to search for L2ARC cacheable content, expressed
as a multiplier of <B>l2arc_write_max</B>.
ARC persistence across reboots can be achieved with persistent L2ARC by setting
this parameter to <B>0</B> allowing the full length of ARC lists to be searched
for cacheable content.
<P>

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>l2arc_headroom_boost</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>l2arc_mfuonly</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Controls whether only MFU metadata and data are cached from ARC into L2ARC.
This may be desired to avoid wasting space on L2ARC when reading/writing large
amounts of data that are not expected to be accessed more than once. The
default is <B>0</B>, meaning both MRU and MFU data and metadata are cached.
When turning off (<B>0</B>) this feature some MRU buffers will still be present
in ARC and eventually cached on L2ARC.
<P>
Use <B>0</B> for no (default) and <B>1</B> for yes.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>l2arc_meta_percent</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Percent of ARC size allowed for L2ARC-only headers.
Since L2ARC buffers are not evicted on memory pressure, too large amount of
headers on system with irrationaly large L2ARC can render it slow or unusable.
This parameter limits L2ARC writes and rebuild to achieve it.
<P>
Default value: <B>33</B>%.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>l2arc_trim_ahead</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Trims ahead of the current write size (<B>l2arc_write_max</B>) on L2ARC devices
by this percentage of write size if we have filled the device. If set to
<B>100</B> we TRIM twice the space required to accommodate upcoming writes. A
minimum of 64MB will be trimmed. It also enables TRIM of the whole L2ARC device
upon creation or addition to an existing pool or if the header of the device is
invalid upon importing a pool or onlining a cache device. A value of <B>0</B>
disables TRIM on L2ARC altogether and is the default as it can put significant
stress on the underlying storage devices. This will vary depending of how well
the specific device handles these commands.
<P>
Default value: <B>0</B>%.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>l2arc_noprefetch</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Do not write buffers to L2ARC if they were prefetched but not used by
applications.
<P>
Use <B>1</B> for yes (default) and <B>0</B> to disable.

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>l2arc_write_boost</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Cold L2ARC devices will have <B>l2arc_write_max</B> increased by this amount
while they remain cold.
<P>
Default value: <B>8,388,608</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>l2arc_write_max</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<P>
Default value: <B>8,388,608</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>l2arc_rebuild_enabled</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Rebuild the L2ARC when importing a pool (persistent L2ARC). This can be
disabled if there are problems importing a pool or attaching an L2ARC device
(e.g. the L2ARC device is slow in reading stored log metadata, or the metadata
has become somehow fragmented/unusable).
<P>
Use <B>1</B> for yes (default) and <B>0</B> for no.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>l2arc_rebuild_blocks_min_l2size</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Min size (in bytes) of an L2ARC device required in order to write log blocks
in it. The log blocks are used upon importing the pool to rebuild
the L2ARC (persistent L2ARC). Rationale: for L2ARC devices less than 1GB, the
amount of data l2arc_evict() evicts is significant compared to the amount of
restored L2ARC data. In this case do not write log blocks in L2ARC in order not
to waste space.
<P>
Default value: <B>1,073,741,824</B> (1GB).
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>metaslab_aliquot</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Metaslab granularity, in bytes. This is roughly similar to what would be
referred to as the &quot;stripe size&quot; in traditional RAID arrays. In normal
operation, ZFS will try to write this amount of data to a top-level vdev
before moving on to the next one.
<P>
Default value: <B>524,288</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>metaslab_bias_enabled</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>metaslab_force_ganging</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

by the test suite to facilitate testing.
<P>
Default value: <B>16,777,217</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_history_output_max</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
When attempting to log the output nvlist of an ioctl in the on-disk history, the
output will not be stored if it is larger than size (in bytes). This must be
less then DMU_MAX_ACCESS (64MB). This applies primarily to
zfs_ioc_channel_program().
<P>

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_keep_log_spacemaps_at_export</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
When using segment-based metaslab selection, continue allocating
from the active metaslab until <B>zfs_metaslab_switch_threshold</B>
worth of buckets have been exhausted.
<P>
Default value: <B>2</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>metaslab_fragmentation_factor_enabled</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Enable use of the fragmentation metric in computing metaslab weights.
<P>
Use <B>1</B> for yes (default) and <B>0</B> for no.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>metaslab_df_max_search</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Maximum distance to search forward from the last offset. Without this limit,
fragmented pools can see &gt;100,000 iterations and metaslab_block_picker()
becomes the performance limiting factor on high-performance storage.
<P>
With the default setting of 16MB, we typically see less than 500 iterations,
even with very fragmented, ashift=9 pools. The maximum number of iterations
possible is: <B>metaslab_df_max_search / (2 * (1&lt;&lt;ashift))</B>.
With the default setting of 16MB this is 16*1024 (with ashift=9) or 2048
(with ashift=12).
<P>
Default value: <B>16,777,216</B> (16MB)
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>metaslab_df_use_largest_segment</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
If we are not searching forward (due to metaslab_df_max_search,
metaslab_df_free_pct, or metaslab_df_alloc_threshold), this tunable controls
what segment is used.  If it is set, we will use the largest free segment.
If it is not set, we will use a segment of exactly the requested size (or
larger).
<P>
Use <B>1</B> for yes and <B>0</B> for no (default).
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_metaslab_max_size_cache_sec</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
When we unload a metaslab, we cache the size of the largest free chunk. We use
that cached size to determine whether or not to load a metaslab for a given
allocation. As more frees accumulate in that metaslab while it's unloaded, the
cached max size becomes less and less accurate. After a number of seconds
controlled by this tunable, we stop considering the cached max size and start
considering only the histogram instead.
<P>
Default value: <B>3600 seconds</B> (one hour)
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_metaslab_mem_limit</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
When we are loading a new metaslab, we check the amount of memory being used
to store metaslab range trees. If it is over a threshold, we attempt to unload
the least recently used metaslab to prevent the system from clogging all of
its memory with range trees. This tunable sets the percentage of total system
memory that is the threshold.
<P>
Default value: <B>25 percent</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_vdev_default_ms_count</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
When a vdev is added target this number of metaslabs per top-level vdev.
<P>
Default value: <B>200</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_vdev_default_ms_shift</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Default limit for metaslab size.
<P>
Default value: <B>29</B> [meaning (1 &lt;&lt; 29) = 512MB].

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Enable metaslab group preloading.
<P>
Use <B>1</B> for yes (default) and <B>0</B> for no.

<P>
<P>


<B>metaslab_lba_weighting_enabled</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Give more weight to metaslabs with lower LBAs, assuming they have
greater bandwidth as is typically the case on a modern constant
angular velocity disk drive.
<P>
Use <B>1</B> for yes (default) and <B>0</B> for no.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>metaslab_unload_delay</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
After a metaslab is used, we keep it loaded for this many txgs, to attempt to
reduce unnecessary reloading. Note that both this many txgs and

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>metaslab_unload_delay_ms</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

attempt to reduce unnecessary reloading. Note that both this many
milliseconds and <B>metaslab_unload_delay</B> txgs must pass before unloading
will occur.

Default value: <B>600000</B> (ten minutes).
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>send_holes_without_birth_time</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

always be sent on zfs send.  This is useful if you suspect your datasets are
affected by a bug in hole_birth.
<P>
Use <B>1</B> for on (default) and <B>0</B> for off.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spa_config_path</B> (charp)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
SPA config file
<P>
Default value: <B>/etc/zfs/zpool.cache</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spa_asize_inflation</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Multiplication factor used to estimate actual disk consumption from the
size of data being written. The default value is a worst case estimate,
but lower values may be valid for a given pool depending on its
configuration.  Pool administrators who understand the factors involved
may wish to specify a more realistic inflation factor, particularly if
they operate close to quota or capacity limits.
<P>
Default value: <B>24</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spa_load_print_vdev_tree</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<P>


<B>spa_load_verify_data</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Whether to traverse data blocks during an &quot;extreme rewind&quot; (<B>-X</B>)
import.  Use 0 to disable and 1 to enable.
<P>
An extreme rewind import normally performs a full traversal of all
blocks in the pool for verification.  If this parameter is set to 0,
the traversal skips non-metadata blocks.  It can be toggled once the
import has started to stop or start the traversal of non-metadata blocks.
<P>
Default value: <B>1</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spa_load_verify_metadata</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Whether to traverse blocks during an &quot;extreme rewind&quot; (<B>-X</B>)
pool import.  Use 0 to disable and 1 to enable.
<P>
An extreme rewind import normally performs a full traversal of all
blocks in the pool for verification.  If this parameter is set to 0,
the traversal is not performed.  It can be toggled once the import has
started to stop or start the traversal.
<P>
Default value: <B>1</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spa_load_verify_shift</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Sets the maximum number of bytes to consume during pool import to the log2
fraction of the target ARC size.
<P>
Default value: <B>4</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spa_slop_shift</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Normally, we don't allow the last 3.2% (1/(2^spa_slop_shift)) of space
in the pool to be consumed.  This ensures that we don't run the pool
completely out of space, due to unaccounted changes (e.g. to the MOS).
It also limits the worst-case time to allocate space.  If we have
less than this amount of free space, most ZPL operations (e.g. write,
create) will return ENOSPC.
<P>
Default value: <B>5</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>vdev_removal_max_span</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
During top-level vdev removal, chunks of data are copied from the vdev
which may include free space in order to trade bandwidth for IOPS.
This parameter determines the maximum span of free space (in bytes)
which will be included as &quot;unnecessary&quot; data in a chunk of copied data.
<P>
The default value here was chosen to align with
<B>zfs_vdev_read_gap_limit</B>, which is a similar concept when doing
regular reads (but there's no reason it has to be the same).
<P>
Default value: <B>32,768</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>vdev_file_logical_ashift</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zap_iterate_prefetch</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

the entire object (all leaf blocks).  However, this is limited by
<B>dmu_prefetch_max</B>.
<P>
Use <B>1</B> for on (default) and <B>0</B> for off.
</DL>

<P>
<P>

This tunable allows ZFS arc to play more nicely with the kernel's LRU
pagecache. It can guarantee that the ARC size won't collapse under scanning
pressure on the pagecache, yet still allows arc to be reclaimed down to

<B>zfs_unflushed_log_block_max</B> (ulong)

can add up to no more than 262144 blocks (which means 32GB of logical
space before compression and ditto blocks, assuming that blocksize is
128k).
<P>
This tunable is important because it involves a trade-off between import
time after an unclean export and the frequency of flushing metaslabs.
The higher this number is, the more log blocks we allow when the pool is
active which means that we flush metaslabs less often and thus decrease
the number of I/Os for spacemap updates per TXG.
At the same time though, that means that in the event of an unclean export,
there will be more log spacemap blocks for us to read, inducing overhead
in the import time of the pool.
The lower the number, the amount of flushing increases destroying log
blocks quicker as they become obsolete faster, which leaves less blocks
to be read during import time after a crash.
<P>
Each log spacemap block existing during pool import leads to approximately
one extra logical I/O issued.
This is the reason why this tunable is exposed in terms of blocks rather
than space used.

Since ZFS is a copy-on-write filesystem with snapshots, blocks cannot be
preallocated for a file in order to guarantee that later writes will not
run out of space.  Instead, fallocate() space preallocation only checks
that sufficient space is currently available in the pool or the user's
project quota allocation, and then creates a sparse file of the requested
size. The requested space is multiplied by <B>zfs_fallocate_reserve_percent</B>
to allow additional space for indirect blocks and other internal metadata.

<B>zfs_free_leak_on_eio</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
If destroy encounters an EIO while reading metadata (e.g. indirect
blocks), space referenced by the missing metadata can not be freed.
Normally this causes the background destroy to become &quot;stalled&quot;, as
it is unable to make forward progress.  While in this stalled state,
all remaining space to free from the error-encountering filesystem is
&quot;temporarily leaked&quot;.  Set this flag to cause it to ignore the EIO,
permanently leak the space from indirect blocks that can not be read,
and continue to free everything else that it can.
<P>
The default, &quot;stalling&quot; behavior is useful if the storage partially
fails (i.e. some but not all i/os fail), and then later recovers.  In
this case, we will be able to continue pool operations while it is
partially failed, and when it recovers, we can continue to free the
space, with no leaks.  However, note that this case is actually
fairly rare.
<P>
Typically pools either (a) fail completely (but perhaps temporarily,
e.g. a top-level vdev going offline), or (b) have localized,
permanent errors (e.g. disk returns the wrong data due to bit flip or
firmware bug).  In case (a), this setting does not matter because the
pool will be suspended and the sync thread will not be able to make
forward progress regardless.  In case (b), because the error is
permanent, the best we can do is leak the minimum amount of space,
which is what setting this flag will do.  Therefore, it is reasonable
for this flag to normally be set, but we chose the more conservative
approach of not setting it, so that there is no possibility of
leaking space in the &quot;partial temporary&quot; failure case.

<B>zfs_max_recordsize</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
We currently support block sizes from 512 bytes to 16MB.  The benefits of
larger blocks, and thus larger I/O, need to be weighed against the cost of
COWing a giant block to modify one byte.  Additionally, very large blocks
can have an impact on i/o latency, and also potentially on the memory
allocator.  Therefore, we do not allow the recordsize to be set larger than
zfs_max_recordsize (default 1MB).  Larger blocks can be created by changing
this tunable, and pools with larger blocks can always be imported and used,
regardless of this setting.

<B>zfs_metaslab_fragmentation_threshold</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Allow metaslabs to keep their active state as long as their fragmentation
percentage is less than or equal to this value. An active metaslab that
exceeds this threshold will no longer keep its active status allowing
better metaslabs to be selected.
<P>
Default value: <B>70</B>.

<B>zfs_mg_fragmentation_threshold</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Metaslab groups are considered eligible for allocations if their
fragmentation metric (measured as a percentage) is less than or equal to
this value. If a metaslab group exceeds this threshold then it will be
skipped unless all metaslab groups within the metaslab class have also
crossed this threshold.
<P>
Default value: <B>95</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>zfs_mg_noalloc_threshold</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Defines a threshold at which metaslab groups should be eligible for
allocations.  The value is expressed as a percentage of free space
beyond which a metaslab group is always eligible for allocations.
If a metaslab group's free space is less than or equal to the
threshold, the allocator will avoid allocating to that group
unless all groups in the pool have reached the threshold.  Once all
groups have reached the threshold, all groups are allowed to accept
allocations.  The default value of 0 disables the feature and causes
all metaslab groups to be eligible for allocations.
<P>
This parameter allows one to deal with pools having heavily imbalanced
vdevs such as would be the case when a new vdev has been added.
Setting the threshold to a non-zero percentage will stop allocations
from being made to vdevs that aren't filled to the specified percentage
and allow lesser filled vdevs to acquire more allocations than they
otherwise would under the old <B>zfs_mg_alloc_failures</B> facility.

Default value: <B>0</B>.

<B>zfs_multihost_interval</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Used to control the frequency of multihost writes which are performed when the
<B>multihost</B> pool property is on.  This is one factor used to determine the
length of the activity check during import.
<P>
The multihost write period is <B>zfs_multihost_interval / leaf-vdevs</B>
milliseconds.  On average a multihost write will be issued for each leaf vdev
every <B>zfs_multihost_interval</B> milliseconds.  In practice, the observed

<B>zfs_multihost_import_intervals</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Used to control the duration of the activity test on import.  Smaller values of

the risk of failing to detect an active pool.  The total activity check time is
never allowed to drop below one second.
<P>
On import the activity check waits a minimum amount of time determined by
<B>zfs_multihost_interval * zfs_multihost_import_intervals</B>, or the same
product computed on the host which last had the pool imported (whichever is
greater).  The activity check time may be further extended if the value of mmp
delay found in the best uberblock indicates actual multihost updates happened

Controls the behavior of the pool when multihost write failures or delays are
detected.
<P>
When <B>zfs_multihost_fail_intervals = 0</B>, multihost write failures or delays
are ignored.  The failures will still be reported to the ZED which depending on
its configuration may take action such as suspending the pool or offlining a
device.
<P>
<P>
When <B>zfs_multihost_fail_intervals &gt; 0</B>, the pool will be suspended if
<B>zfs_multihost_fail_intervals * zfs_multihost_interval</B> milliseconds pass
without a successful mmp write.  This guarantees the activity test will see
mmp writes if the pool is imported.  A value of 1 is ignored and treated as
if it was set to 2.  This is necessary to prevent the pool from being suspended
due to normal, small I/O latency variations.

<B>zfs_prefetch_disable</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This tunable disables predictive prefetch.  Note that it leaves &quot;prescient&quot;
prefetch (e.g. prefetch for zfs send) intact.  Unlike predictive prefetch,
prescient prefetch never issues i/os that end up not being needed, so it

If an indirect split block contains more than this many possible unique
combinations when being reconstructed, consider it too computationally
expensive to check them all. Instead, try at most
<B>zfs_reconstruct_indirect_combinations_max</B> randomly-selected

<B>zfs_scan_fill_weight</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This tunable affects how scrub and resilver I/O segments are ordered. A higher
number indicates that we care more about how filled in a segment is, while a
lower number indicates we care more about the size of the extent without

<B>zfs_scan_mem_lim_fact</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Maximum fraction of RAM used for I/O sorting by sequential scan algorithm.
This tunable determines the hard limit for I/O sorting memory usage.

<B>zfs_scan_mem_lim_soft_fact</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The fraction of the hard limit used to determined the soft limit for I/O sorting
by the sequential scan algorithm. When we cross this limit from below no action

to converge. However, in practice disabling compression increases the average
number of sync passes, because when we turn compression off, a lot of block's
size will change and thus we have to re-allocate (not overwrite) them. It
also increases the number of 128KB allocations (e.g. for indirect blocks and
spacemaps) because these will not be compressed. The 128K allocations are
especially detrimental to performance on highly fragmented systems, which may
have very few free segments of this size, and may need to load new metaslabs
to satisfy 128K allocations.

<H2>ZFS I/O SCHEDULER</H2>

ZFS issues I/O operations to leaf vdevs to satisfy and complete I/Os.
The I/O scheduler determines when and in what order those operations are
issued.  The I/O scheduler divides operations into five I/O classes
prioritized in the following order: sync read, sync write, async read,
async write, and scrub/resilver.  Each queue defines the minimum and
maximum number of concurrent operations that may be issued to the
device.  In addition, the device has an aggregate maximum,
<B>zfs_vdev_max_active</B>. Note that the sum of the per-queue minimums
must not exceed the aggregate maximum.  If the sum of the per-queue
maximums exceeds the aggregate maximum, then the number of active I/Os
may reach <B>zfs_vdev_max_active</B>, in which case no further I/Os will
be issued regardless of whether all per-queue minimums have been met.
<P>
For many physical devices, throughput increases with the number of
concurrent operations, but latency typically suffers. Further, physical
devices typically have a limit at which more concurrent operations have no
effect on throughput or can actually cause it to decrease.
<P>
The scheduler selects the next operation to issue by first looking for an
I/O class whose minimum has not been satisfied. Once all are satisfied and
the aggregate maximum has not been hit, the scheduler looks for classes
whose maximum has not been satisfied. Iteration through the I/O classes is
done in the order specified above. No further operations are issued if the
aggregate maximum number of concurrent operations has been hit or if there
are no operations queued for an I/O class that has not hit its maximum.
Every time an I/O is queued or an operation completes, the I/O scheduler
looks for new operations to issue.
<P>
In general, smaller max_active's will lead to lower latency of synchronous
operations.  Larger max_active's may lead to higher overall throughput,
depending on underlying storage.
<P>
The ratio of the queues' max_actives determines the balance of performance
between reads, writes, and scrubs.  E.g., increasing
<B>zfs_vdev_scrub_max_active</B> will cause the scrub or resilver to complete
more quickly, but reads and writes to have higher latency and lower throughput.
<P>
All I/O classes have a fixed maximum number of outstanding operations
except for the async write class. Asynchronous writes represent the data
that is committed to stable storage during the syncing stage for
transaction groups. Transaction groups enter the syncing state
periodically so the number of queued async writes will quickly burst up
and then bleed down to zero. Rather than servicing them as quickly as
possible, the I/O scheduler changes the maximum number of active async
write I/Os according to the amount of dirty data in the pool.  Since
both throughput and latency typically increase with the number of
concurrent operations issued to physical devices, reducing the
burstiness in the number of concurrent operations also stabilizes the
response time of operations from other -- and in particular synchronous
-- queues. In broad strokes, the I/O scheduler will issue more
concurrent operations from the async write queue as there's more dirty
data in the pool.
<P>
Async Writes
<P>
The number of concurrent operations issued for the async write I/O class
follows a piece-wise linear function defined by a few adjustable points.
<PRE>

               `--------- zfs_vdev_async_write_active_min_dirty_percent

</PRE>

Until the amount of dirty data exceeds a minimum percentage of the dirty
data allowed in the pool, the I/O scheduler will limit the number of
concurrent operations to the minimum. As that threshold is crossed, the
number of concurrent operations issued increases linearly to the maximum at
the specified maximum percentage of the dirty data allowed in the pool.
<P>
Ideally, the amount of dirty data on a busy pool will stay in the sloped
part of the function between <B>zfs_vdev_async_write_active_min_dirty_percent</B>
and <B>zfs_vdev_async_write_active_max_dirty_percent</B>. If it exceeds the
maximum percentage, this indicates that the rate of incoming data is
greater than the rate that the backend storage can handle. In this case, we
must further throttle incoming writes, as described in the next section.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ZFS TRANSACTION DELAY</H2>

We delay transactions when we've determined that the backend storage
isn't able to accommodate the rate of incoming writes.
<P>
If there is already a transaction waiting, we delay relative to when
that transaction will finish waiting.  This way the calculated delay time
is independent of the number of threads concurrently executing
transactions.
<P>
If we are the only waiter, wait relative to when the transaction
started, rather than the current time.  This credits the transaction for
&quot;time already served&quot;, e.g. reading indirect blocks.
<P>
The minimum time for a transaction to take is calculated as:
<PRE>
    min_time = zfs_delay_scale * (dirty - min) / (max - dirty)
    min_time is then capped at 100 milliseconds.
</PRE>

<P>
The delay has two degrees of freedom that can be adjusted via tunables.  The
percentage of dirty data at which we start to delay is defined by
<B>zfs_delay_min_dirty_percent</B>. This should typically be at or above
<B>zfs_vdev_async_write_active_max_dirty_percent</B> so that we only start to
delay after writing at full speed has failed to keep up with the incoming write
rate. The scale of the curve is defined by <B>zfs_delay_scale</B>. Roughly speaking,
this variable determines the amount of delay at the midpoint of the curve.

<P>
Note that since the delay is added to the outstanding time remaining on the
most recent transaction, the delay is effectively the inverse of IOPS.
Here the midpoint of 500us translates to 2000 IOPS. The shape of the curve
was chosen such that small changes in the amount of accumulated dirty data
in the first 3/4 of the curve yield relatively small differences in the
amount of delay.
<P>
The effects can be easier to understand when the amount of delay is
represented on a log scale:

</PRE>

<P>
Note here that only as the amount of dirty data approaches its limit does
the delay start to increase rapidly. The goal of a properly tuned system
should be to keep the amount of dirty data out of that range by first
ensuring that the appropriate limits are set for the I/O scheduler to reach
optimal throughput on the backend storage, and then by changing the value
of <B>zfs_delay_scale</B> to increase the steepness of the curve.
